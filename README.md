# Excel Comparison Tool

This tool automatically compares two Excel workbooks — “Actual” and “Expected” — across all common sheets. It checks both text and numeric columns, highlights statistical differences, and generates a clean, downloadable report for each pair.

**Designed for financial model validation, data audits, and reconciliation workflows.**
